# Quiz Pense Bem Sonic

## About
The goal of this project is to create an educational game based on 'Pense Bem' that is set in the Sonic universe. By referencing the book 'A aventura cient√≠fica com Sonic,' I've developed a game that is both fun and informative. The game's interface has been designed to capture the essence of the Sonic franchise, making it appealing to a wide range of players.

##Game Flow:
-Home Screen: Displays the main game interface, serving as the starting point.
-Book Selection: The user navigates to a library of books. Selecting a book reveals the unique rules and scoring criteria associated with that specific title.
-Quiz Initiation: The player is presented with the first question tailored to the selected book.
-Interactive Quiz: As the player answers each question, they receive immediate feedback indicating whether their response is correct or incorrect. Their score is dynamically updated throughout the quiz.
-Results Screen: Once the quiz is finished, the player's final score is presented. From here, they have the option to return to the home screen to select a different book and start a new quiz.
